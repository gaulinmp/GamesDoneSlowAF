## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

-   To create a **normal user account**, ask. Seriously, automating the sign up is dumb so I won't do it.

-   To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
